# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Palin

I'm a physics graduate and incoming Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at Queen's University. I'm passionate about robotics, deep learning, and building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems through autonomy and data-driven decision-making.

- 🤖 Currently building robots with **ROS 2**, **LiDAR**, and **SLAM**
- 🧠 Exploring reinforcement learning and sim-to-real robotics
- 💡 Interested in AI for physical systems, control, and embedded robotics
- 🎓 Preparing for my MEng in Fall 2025 with a focus on automation and locomotion

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Autonomous SLAM Robot](https://github.com/danielwp22/ros2-navigation-bot)
> A real-world 2-wheel robot with LiDAR, ROS 2, and SLAM. Fully autonomous path planning using Nav2.

### 🔹 [Blackjack RL Agent](https://github.com/danielwp22/blackjack-rl-agent)
> A deep Q-learning agent trained to beat the house in Gymnasium's blackjack environment using PyTorch.

### 🔹 [Four-Leaf Clover Classifier](https://github.com/danielwp22/four-leaf-clover-classification)
> An image classifier trained on a self-collected clover dataset using ResNet18. Achieved 80% accuracy.

### 🔹 [Cracked Concrete Classifier](https://github.com/danielwp22/cracked-concrete-classifier)
> Detects cracked vs uncracked concrete surfaces using a ResNet model. Achieved 99% validation accuracy.
